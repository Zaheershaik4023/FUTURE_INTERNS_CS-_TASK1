Assessment Report (2026)
Name: SHAIK ABDUL ZAHEER
Registration Number: RA2411030020266
University: SRM University Ramapuram
Department & Year: Cyber Security – 2nd Year
Internship Program: Future Interns – Cyber Security (2026)
Target Website: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
Executive Summary
This report documents a passive vulnerability assessment conducted as part of the Future Interns
Cyber Security Internship Program (2026). The objective was to evaluate the publicly exposed
security posture of a website without exploiting vulnerabilities.
Scope & Methodology
The assessment scope was limited to passive reconnaissance. Techniques included analysis of
HTTP response headers, TLS configuration review, and safe network scanning. No intrusive or
exploitative actions were performed.
Findings
1. HTTPS & TLS: Secure TLS encryption is implemented with a valid certificate.
2. Missing HSTS Header: Absence of Strict-Transport-Security increases exposure to downgrade
and SSL stripping attacks.
3. Server Disclosure: The web server reveals nginx information via headers.
Risk Assessment
Missing HSTS: Medium Risk
Server Disclosure: Low Risk
Remediation Recommendations
• Configure Strict-Transport-Security with a long max-age value.
• Enforce comprehensive HTTP security headers.
• Conduct periodic passive security reviews.
Supporting Evidence
Screenshots to be attached during GitHub submission:
• Browser Network Headers
• OWASP ZAP Passive Scan Summary
• Nmap Safe Scan Output
Conclusion
The assessed website demonstrates a secure foundation but can be further strengthened by
implementing missing transport security controls. The recommendations align with industry best
practices and improve overall resilience.
